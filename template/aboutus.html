            	<p><h1>FRESH Fruit Juices</h1>
            		<p><h3>Food:</h3>
					Sitafal and Strawberry are the best ones they offer. They are really thick and two of the shakes can replace one of your meals as they are served with fresh fruits. Their shakes used to be even better few months back but have been only deteriorating since then!</p>

					<p><h3>Service:</h3>
					Same goes with the service, they were open till midnight and even longer before but now they shut the place at 11PM! The staff isn't friendly at all and can be really rude sometimes. Considering the great shakes they offer, if their staff is friendly, it will definitely boost up their sales even further!</p>

					<p><h3>Price:</h3>
					The prices are rightly set! The small sitafal shake is around Rs.70 which is fair enough considering the quality and the thickness of the shake. 
					Fruit juice is 100% pure juice made from the flesh of fresh fruit or from whole fruit, depending on the type used. It is not permitted to add sugars, sweeteners, preservatives, flavourings or colourings to fruit juice.</p>

					<p><h3>Fruit juices are usually described as:</h3>

					From concentrate
					Not from concentrate
					Freshly squeezed
					Fruit juice from concentrate</p>

					Juice is extracted from the fruit and the water content is reduced (by evaporating off the water naturally present) in the country of origin. The concentrated juice is usually frozen and shipped to the country of use for packing. Fruit juice packers then reconstitute the juice by adding back the water.

					Not from concentrate juice

					Juice is extracted from the fruit in the country of origin and then lightly pasteurised and frozen, chilled or aseptically transported to the country where it will be packed.
